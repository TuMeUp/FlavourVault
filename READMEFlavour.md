# FlavourVault
A digital home for flavours, memories, and the recipes that bring people together.

FlavourVault is a growing archive built to honour the meals that shaped us, the stories carried through food, and the knowledge passed down through families and communities. It treats recipes not just as instructions, but as pieces of identity, history, and connection.

# Purpose
FlavourVault exists to:

Preserve meaningful recipes alongside the memories that give them life

Protect cultural and family knowledge so it can be carried forward

Create a space where food, story, and identity can be organised and remembered

Support connection across generations through shared flavours and experiences

## Getting Started
FlavourVault is in its early development stage. As the project grows, this section will include setup instructions, structure, and development notes.

For now, explore the repository, shape the direction, and imagine the stories and recipes this vault will one day hold.

## Roadmap
Establish the core structure (recipes, stories, images, notes)

Create a simple and meaningful recipe format

Add tagging and categorisation

Explore options for a web or app interface

Document design decisions and long‑term vision

## Contributing
FlavourVault will continue to evolve. Contributions, ideas, and improvements are welcome as this archive grows into a richer and more meaningful space.
